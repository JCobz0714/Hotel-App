# Hotel App API

This will be an API project for practice, using Springboot Framework, might be adding some front-end to it later on, meanwhile this will be a back-end project only.

The purpose of this project is to make a hotel booking service using APIs
made with Spring Boot Framework.

My goal is to learn simple nested relationships among
entities, dates and validations and CRUD with dependencies.
